Spring Interceptors..

we can create interceptor using - extends (abstrct class) HandlerInterceptorAdapter.

HandlerInterceptorAdapter implements - (interface) AsyncHandlerInterceptor - extends  (Interface) HandlerInterceptor

methods in Interceptors

boolean preHandle(HttpRequest request,HttpResponse response , Object obj);

This will be exceuted before request is being handed over to the handler method.

it should return true,in order to let Spring know to process the request through another
spring interceptor or to send it to handler method if there are no further spring interceptors.

If it return flase, it means the request is hadled by interceptor itself and we need to return a response object.

Object handler is the chosen handler object to handle the request.

void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object obj,
			ModelAndView modelAndView)

This will be executed when HandlerAdapter has invoked the handler but DispatcherServlet is yet to render the view. 
This help us in doing any modification, or to show any information using model and view. 
			
			
void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
           Object handler, Exception ex)
		   
This is a HandlerInterceptor callback method that is called once the handler is executed and view is rendered.
		   
		   
To add an interceptor we need to extend our class with WebMvcConfigurerAdapter and we need to override addRegistery() - method.

example:-

@Override

	public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
		registry.addInterceptor(new SreekarInterceptor());  -- this will be called for all request 
		registry.addInterceptor(new SreekarInterceptor()).addPathPatterns("/person/save/*");  --  this will be called only if the path matches.
	}
	
  addPathPattren is used for adding specific pattren to intercept.
  excludePathPatterns is used to exclude the interceptor 
  
 we can use xml file also 
 
 <mvc:interceptors>
    <bean class="Interceptors class"/>
	
	excluding interceptor
    <mvc:interceptor>
        <mvc:mapping path="/**"/>
        <mvc:exclude-mapping path="/admin/**"/>
        <bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.theme.ThemeChangeInterceptor"/>
    </mvc:interceptor>
	
    <mvc:interceptor>
        <!-- intercept multiple urls -->
        <mvc:mapping path="/secure/*"/>
        <mvc:mapping path="/admin/**"/>
        <mvc:mapping path="/profile/**"/>
        <bean class="org.example.SecurityInterceptor"/>
    </mvc:interceptor>
	
</mvc:interceptors>
