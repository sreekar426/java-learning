Singleton can be breaked in three ways 

1. Using Reflection
2. Using Serialization 
3. Using Cloning 

To Avoid these we need to do the following.

1.For Reflection 
we need implement ENUM , ENUM will be initailized only once.

2.For Serilization 
we need to override readValues method to overcome this

3.For Cloning 
we need to override clone method and should thorw clone not supported exception
